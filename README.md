# Hotel Booking Analysis and Guest Insights

## Overview

This project analyzes hotel reservation data to determine significant trends in guest activity, booking patterns, cancellation rates, and drivers of revenue. Utilizing visual dashboards, it provides high-season booking windows, customer activity, and areas of business improvement such as cancellation decline and enhanced guest retention initiatives. 


## Key Metrics

**Guest Trends**
Guests numbered 234.99K and hit a high in 2016 but dropped in 2017. The highest demand was for Room Type A, which varied by season, having its highest bookings in middle of the year.

**Booking Trends & Cancellation Insights**
Urban hotels had a longer lead times (109.7 days) than resorts (92.7 days). Only 3.2% of total guests were repeat customers, and they had a high cancellation rate of 37%. Weekend bookings were weak, with business travelers driving the weekend bookings for the most part during the weekdays.

**Guests Demographics**
An adult guest majority booked the majority of visitors (222K), along with a prominent increase in infant guest bookings (+76%). Bookings came majorly from Portuguese, British, French, and Spanish guests, and targeting all these markets has been suggested. Individual transient guest bookings comprised most reservations, but bookings based on family also gained popularity.
A majority of the guests chose Bed & Breakfast (BB) over Full Board (FB) and Half Board (HB). There were more bookings made by some of the travel agents, indicating a need to create relationships with high-yielding agents.

## Key Recommendations

**Minimize Cancellations:** Tighten up cancellation policies or offer incentives to reduce no-shows.

**Maximize Repeat Guests:** Establish loyalty programs or promotions to attract more repeat business.

**Target Peak Booking Months:** Redirect marketing strategies to peak-demand months (August and December).

**Maximize Meal Plans:** Offer Half Board (HB) and Full Board (FB) to maximize meal plan revenue.
